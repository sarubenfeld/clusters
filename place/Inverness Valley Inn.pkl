VLovely, peaceful place with excellent access to Point Reyes National Seashore.  Came in late at night after our first lodging was accidently double booked and all the campsites were filled for 30 miles.  Host was gracious and met us late at night with instructions for getting in.  We stayed in number 18;  it was much more than two people needed but we were grateful that we had somewhere to stay!  It ended up being one of the most peaceful evenings we had on the coast...The cottages are well appointed, clean and have everything you need for an extended stay or a luxurious secluded weekend.  The grounds are nicely landscaped and the flowers add a delightful fragrance when you are walking around the property.  I would definitely stay here again.

VI am not one to complain, but I am: did not look like website, unkempt landscaping, very funky check in, room was very hot/ no AC, stinky bathroom, stains on sheets and towels, extremely loud plumbing, thin walls (heard the toddler next door), our room service was "forgotten", office (if you could find it) was a disorganized uninviting mess, many curt do and don't signs throughout the room, seems like owners want to be in small farm business (chickens, goats, sheep on the grounds) more than lodging business; one or the other, but both are not working!!!!!!!!!!!  \u000aWill not return and cannot recommend; spend your money elsewhere!
