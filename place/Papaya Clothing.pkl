VMost companies try to treat there customers with respect and try to make things right when a customer has had a problem. I did not find this to be true with this company. When i was in the store its self no one was really around to help or answer questions but, i did give it another chance by ordering things online for a friends birthday. They ended up sending me someone elses order so i returned it and they told me they would send me my order out as soon as possible. When i received my order it wasn't the right items in the colors i wanted, I did not get one of the shirts and the other shirt was damaged. It took a month to get the items that were damaged/ or not the colors i asked for and  I didn't get the items in time for the birthday. When i returned them they decided to charge me for the return shipping even thou they were the ones that had messed up my order. I asked to be reimbursed the shipping cost but they refused because its apparently corporate policy to screw there customers. i would not recommend this store to anyone. i would rather pay a little more and actually get what i paid for.
