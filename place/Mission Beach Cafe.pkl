VWhile we had a great time and the food was delish, my meal (a seafood eggs benedict) wound me up in the hospital. I had Salmonella poisoning something fierce, and I was in Alta Bates for a week (no joke, it was so painful and I was so, so sick)!!! After speaking with a CDC specialist at the hospital, and we talked about everything else I'd eaten in days prior, he concluded that was the only place I could have gotten it. After I left the hospital and began to feel better, I called MBC to let them know what had happened. Keep in mind, I know I can't prove my food poisoning came from there, and I didn't expect them to do anything to fix the problem. The CDC specialist said though that most restaurant owners will offer some sort of compensation and apology, and that it was important that they know what had happened. I spoke to a manager at the MBC, and they immediately (and rather rudely) said "You can't prove anything. You're the only one who's complained, so I don't see what you want us to do about it." WHAT A JERK. I wouldn't have bothered to leave a negative review, except that I was so unhappy with how rude the manager was about the whole situation. The least they could have done was assure me they'd review their sanitation practices.

VGreat place to host visiting guests for brunch (or friends and family). There is definitely a wait but the food and atmosphere definitely is worth it. The French Toast, Pancakes and eggs Benedict are all amazing and they also have a strong dinner menu with one of my favorite burgers in the city.

VI was REALLY craving a nice egg benedict. So much so that I took a lyft 2 miles away to get to this place even though there were plenty of restaurants closer to me in proximity. I was however disappointed. \u000a\u000a1st: The wait on a Saturday morning isn't as bad as I thought. It's about a 10-15 min wait and you place your name on a list and wait to be called. It's pretty simple and they even have a couple of benches outside to sit on while you wait. It went by pretty fast. \u000a\u000a2nd: The inside is quite cozy. Isn't a very large restaurant but the service is pretty quick so they do have a decent turn around. \u000a\u000a3rd: Price is super affordable. The drinks (mimosas) were actually the same price of my meal.  I paid about 14.50 for my crab benedict. \u000a\u000aNow on to the meal and my disappointment.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Crab Benedict with avocado, hollandaise,and potatoes (it also had shrimp). When I got my Benedict and sliced open the egg it was OVERCOOKED. I mean it was a boiled egg. I told my waitress to please correct the dish and she was a bit confused thinking a egg benedict came with a boiled egg. No biggie. They redid my meal but this time the dish was super cold. I didn't want to complain yet again and was super hungry so decided to just eat the meal. Besides it being cold and at first having a boiled egg, the meal was decent. The potatoes were amazing and I had some of my friends truffle fries and they were spectacular. \u000a\u000aAlso service was a bit off. We had some trouble with the bill and it was a complete hassle trying to pay the bill.

VI wish I had two additional hands so I could give this place a four thumbs down. The cafe was recommended to me by a local friend, as well as Google/Yelp, and I was quite excited to patronize.\u000a\u000aWe waited more than 50mins for a seat and then an additional 10mins to be greeted by our waitress who would eventually transfer us to one of her peers. \u000a\u000aThe speed in which the food came was actually pretty quick. I ordered my eggs over medium, but to my dismay they came over easy & oozed throughout the plate.\u000a\u000aAs a result of my experience, I can't speak too favorably on the restaurant. Everyone else around my table seemed to enjoy themselves & their food, so maybe I'm an extremity nonetheless enter with caution.
