VTERRIBLE  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  ALL OF THE WAITERS HAD A CRAPPY ATTITUDE.  SOON AS WE ARRIVED  FOR OUR FIRST  TIME THERE NO ONE GREETED US. WE HAD TO ASK CAN WE BE SEATED. WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF  TO GET  OUR FOOD. WE HAD TO ENQUIRE  ABOUT  OUR FOOD. THE CORNBREAD LOOK LIKE TWO MARBLES THE YAMS WERE STRINGY THE GREENS TASTED LIKE WATER.  THE BLACK EYE PEAS WERE GOOD. THE FRIED CHICKEN  WAS GOOD. YOU HAD FLAG DOWN  THE  WAITERS  FOR ANYTHING  YOU NEED. THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE  WHY  BLACK OWNED BUSINESS  GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THE MIND SET HAS TO CHANGE. THIS BUSINESS  MAKE YOU NOT WANT TO COME BACK. IT'S IN A ISOLATED  LOCATION.  THE TYPE  OF CUSTOMER  SERVICE  IS WHY OTHER ETHNIC  GROUPS  CAN COME IN WITH A SIMILAR  RESTAURANT  AND YOU RIGHT  OUT OF BUSINESS. NO HOSPITALITY AT ALL.

VSee, I have some other soul food restaurants of which I've become a regular. It was not til recently that I decided to give this one another try. Ive had a bone to pick with Nellies a time or two for those attitudes. The cooks are nice as well as some of the hostesses BUT the owner/main woman has to work on that personality, we are customers in a restaurant, not 10th graders in a high school lunchroom, treat customers like they matter and let people know if you don't have something for a to go order. In other words communicate with your team on current inventory. Don't just put whatever you have and the customer gets to their destination, to find a shorted order(because you ran out and put one spoonful of this, a spoonful of that, on top of this to cover up not having that). Stale fish full of dark grease. Fix your operations, heck, fix everything you can! Im tired of feeling like I have to kill you with kindness, only to get a cold uncouth shoulder, barely a greeting upon speaking to you first(really?), a dirty look, and some food where only half of it is good(threw half of it out). Lastly, work on that cornbread! What's up with the cornbread? It's like they cooked it a day or two before....it used to be soft fluffy crispy, organic, beautiful....now it's....well....weird. However you will have to prove yourself to ever get my money again. Back to cooking soul food.....\U0001f60a

VI'm an Oakland native and I have never been so disappointed. We waited for over an hour for our over priced yet bland food I ordered ox tails with rice gravy and yams the oxtaisl were flavorless the yams were bitter and the complimentary cornbread was less than a compliment \U0001f44e. My friend ordered a cube steak which turned out to be dry as paper \U0001f44emy son had fried chicken and prawns which was fairly good. All in all the food was less than mediocre  service unsatisfactory wouldn't recommend them to anyone.

VI just spent a week in the Bay area, and this place was the best restaurant we ate at. Being from Texas I was looking for some comfort food. The fried porkchops where the ticket. All the side's where great as well. I had the green, black-eyed pea's and rice with gravy. The only downside was that we found this place the day we were leaving. If I'm ever back in town I will make this my first choice.
