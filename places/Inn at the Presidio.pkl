VWe stayed at the Inn for two nights April 27 and 28.  The property and the stay were both much better than expected.  We have visited San Francisco many times, always staying at hotels either on Nob Hill or on Union Square.  This property and location is particularly unique and was perfectly suited to our interests.  We were very warmly greeted when we arrived early and our room was ready at the moment of our arrival.  We chatted with another couple that had arrived shortly after we did and we discovered that we were both there to celebrate wedding anniversaries.  This was a conversation that was overheard by the staff and to our surprise, when we returned to our room before going to dinner there was a card of congratulations for our anniversary signed by the entire staff along with a complimentary bottle of wine and a box of chocolates!  Very nice touch!  \u000a\u000aThe hotel is in very good condition, the rooms are neat and well-kept and are extremely comfortable.  We stayed in a Classic King Tier 3.  Very nice room, but if you are on Tier 3, you do not have access to the second-floor porch.  When we return to the Inn we plan on booking a Classic King Tier 2 so that we may enjoy the porch.  Words cannot adequately describe how much of a different San Francisco feel you get from staying at the Presidio as opposed to a traditional hotel location in the City.  True, there is not the availability of higher-end maid and butler service, there is no room service with meals to be delivered to your room.  But what you do get is immediately upon your exit from the door of the property you enter into the grand expanse of what is the Presidio!  A very long and distant view of the Bay, massive areas of lawn and trees and foliage.  Row after row of architecturally-beautiful buildings, all dripping in a long and rich history which is so unique to San Francisco and to California.  There is no clanging of the Cable-Car bells, no sirens to be heard all hours of the day, no dodging in and out of herds of people.  No fear of being bumped into and being had by a pick-pocket.  There is the notable absence of the street people and pan-handlers that are frequented at other tourist spots throughout the City.  There is a great spans of trails and paths that will take you deep into wooded areas to the extent that you will feel as though the city were miles away.  If you enjoy a walk, and even a hike, this is the place for you!\u000aThere is the availability of a shuttle service that will take you into the city, which we did for dinner the two evenings we stayed.  We had lunch on site while we were there.  This first day we ate at the Canteen, which is nice, but we preferred the fare offered at the Bowling Center, of all places!  \u000aWhen we returned after dinner Tuesday evening, we were a bit chilled from our evening's walk and we asked if there was cocoa, and to our pleasure, Sergio prepared two cups for us (no charge) which we enjoyed out in the back at the fire pit.\u000a\u000aThis is a very delightful property and you should go and experience it first hand.  This is a San Francisco experience like you have never had!  San Francisco is a wonderful one-of-a-kind City.  The Presidio experience makes it all that much more unique!

VI'm not quire sure why there's only one review on this historic hotel. We checked in for the weekend and we've been so impressed and happy with everything. The renovations are spectacular, keeping the original charm of history, extremely tastefully decorated suites, paying attention to detail, good food, great atmosphere, it's an experience that I'll remember for years to come. Can't wait to plan my next staycation here. job well done! Classic and modern meet at this amazing hotel.
