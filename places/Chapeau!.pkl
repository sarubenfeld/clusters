VBit late writing this review, but it was so good it's hard to forget. I went here for dine about town, but sadly the fine print stated that it wasn't available for Friday nights. This wasn't a big deal since the set meal was only a $5 more expensive. \u000a\u000aMeal was outstanding. The appetizers we got were escargots and foe gras. Wasn't the hugest fan of the escargot sauce, but the foie gras was divine. \u000a\u000aThe main meal course was Skate and some other fish I've never heard of before (began with a b). Both were incredible. \u000a\u000aDessert, creme brulee. Excellent, but not the best I've ever had. \u000a\u000aI left feeling thoroughly stuffed and satisfied. \u000a\u000aService was great. Only way I ever deduct for service is if the waiter screws up the order or reservations aren't honored and I'm waiting for ages.

VLove this French restaurant! Been there for a few times in the last couple of year, food has always been great! Ask them about their hidden menu because you might just really like the sound of it! Also be sure to leave room for desserts because they are all so good!!

VCame here for our first anniversary celebration. We'll probably have to wait another year to come back because we're poor college students.\u000a\u000aFood: My boyfriend praised the complimentary fish with potato salad on a spoon, he said he didn't want to swallow it because it tasted so damn good. I don't eat shellfish, so I decided to stay away from seafood in general. I'm like an opposite pescetarian. The waiter asked me why I didn't eat it and I told him, he was very nice and got me a slice of baguette with tomato sauce on it, which was wonderful. On to appetizers, I had the onion soup. It was alright, I guess since I love my mother's onion soup, it's hard to match it. I found it was a bit dull, it had no bang to the initial mouthful. Then my entree was the Cassoulet de Toulouse, it was nice, very filling. The lamb was cooked perfectly. It was still moist and kept it's flavor. But I enjoyed my boyfriend's filet mignon much more, he had it with the Sauce à la Périgourdine, and it was just indescribably good. Then for dessert I had the Banana Panna Cotta/ Strawberry Salad/ Shortbread. I think that the shortbread could of been either smaller or thinner. This reminded me of strawberry shortcake. It was wonderful none the less. I could taste the strawberry more than the banana panna cotta. Just reviewing it now, reminded me it was banana rather than strawberry panna cotta. \u000a\u000aAtmosphere: My boyfriend and I came in semiformal. Sadly there was no dress code, yes, I wished there were a loose dress code. It boosts the atmosphere. Since this seems like a very nice place. There were people coming in, in sweats and t shirts. It was very cramped in the restaurant. You would imagine a place would have quiet conversations where everyone seems to be whispering. But not this place, everyone is so close it turns into a loud hum, just below a Chinese restaurant.\u000a\u000aService: The waiter was very nice and very personable. He had quite a thick French accent so when he was telling us the specials it was sort of hard to hear. No problems though, he was nice enough to tell us what we miss with out being irked about it. He also offered to take my coat to the coat room and at the end he held it out for me to put it back on. I'm not use to this service so I felt very awkward. He was really good with recommendations. The chef also came out and greeted everyone, shook everyone's hand and initiated conversations. He reminded me of the chef in a queen latifah movie...Last Holiday. At the end of the meal my boyfriend and I stepped out the door and the chef came out just to say goodbye to us. He shook my hand, kissed each of my cheek then shook my boyfriends hand and said hope to see you soon! For sure it's a place I would like to go back to, just when I have a bit more money.
