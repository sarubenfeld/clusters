VMy wife's son recommended this Cajun style cafe to us while we were in town for a few days on work related stuff.We walked here from our hotel in Nob Hill just a few hours after we flew in from San Diego.There was quite a full house at around 1.30pm when we arrived.We were both pretty famished after a lousy excuse for a breakfast at San Diego airport very early that morning.Even if we had not been to New Orleans previously we would still love this flavorsome style of food.I chose not to have a beer with lunch as I am not a big fan of  Abita and there was nothing else to choose that I liked.We enjoyed our meals thoroughly and had an interesting chat with the young couple at the table beside us.We found out on our next visit here to have breakfast that they only stock whole milk for their lattes and cappuccinos.Since we only prefer non-fat or 2% at worst we had to pass on having breakfast here.Other than that this is a terrific place to get a nice feed.

VEating here always leaves me very, very satisfied. Get the beignet sampler, featuring fresh fried beignets with crawfish, apples, and chocolate fillings. The soul food ranging from shrimp and grits to fried chicken has never disappointed. Expect a line but the food's well worth the wait.

VCame to Brenda's on a Superbowl Sunday. This place is quite small, and there is really no parking in front of it, but you can't miss it since there's usually a bunch of people standing outside of the restaurant. Even though we came at around 11 to 12ish, we still had to wait for about ten minutes. They have a cool chalkboard where you write your name on it. Unfortunately, they only seat you when your entire party is present, and with the parking situation, that's a little difficult. \u000a\u000aIt's a very nice place that really reflects on the French soul food that Brenda's serves. Lots of nice decorations, and though it's small, it's very high in the ceiling (from what I remember), which gives it a lot of air space, if that makes sense. It wasn't too crowded or anything. \u000a\u000aOur table ordered Catfish Po' Boy, Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Crispy Pork Belly, French Toast with the additional butter pecan sauce, and Shrimp and Grits I believe. On top of that, we ordered a Beignet Flight for the entire table to share. The waitresses seemed to be very busy as the tables were all full. They weren't mean, but they weren't overly friendly either; however, I did understand that they were very busy, and the food did make up for it. \u000a\u000aThe watermelon tea was very good. There's bits of watermelon in there, and it tastes really refreshing. With the added refills, I do believe this tea is worth the $2.75. The Beignet Flight was pretty darn amazing. Four different beignets (one of basically each one they have): one is a plain one, one filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate, another with Granny smith apples that have been sweetened with cinnamon honey butter, and the last is the savory one with crawfish that has been spiced with cayenne, scallions and cheddar. I have to say that out of the three (I didn't try the plain one), I liked the granny smith one the best. Full of flavor and I could taste the cinnamon honey butter. I loved the powdered sugar on top. Basically tastes like a very sweet doughnut. I didn't care too much for the savory one. It was good, but I think I prefer the beignets to be sweet. \u000a\u000aAnd then the food! I was already a little full from the beignets, but I had to make room for the Catfish Po' Boy. I think this dish knocked it out of the park for me. I really liked it. I am typically a fan of sandwiches, so I really liked the concept of this dish. Soul food with a little twist. The dish was filled with fries and the sandwich was pretty big. I ended up eating only half. The fish was good, and so was the sauce and the baguette it was served on. I had to smear the sauce onto the bread so there would be more taste for the entire sandwich. They also give you pickled watermelon on the side. Not sure what that was for, but ate it as a refresher. I liked the sandwich a lot. Worth the money and tasted great. I tried the pulled pork eggs benedict. It came with grits or hash, and we opted for the potatoes, which weren't that great. But the biscuits that the pulled pork eggs benedict were served on were pretty tasty. As for the other dishes, everybody else really liked them. \u000a\u000aBy the end of the meal, the restaurant was less packed, and the waitresses were more relaxed, and helped fill the drinks a few times. I wasn't a big fan of soul food, but this place really made me enjoy it! Have to give it 5 stars as I don't usually eat this type of food, and they made it an A+ experience in my book. \u000a\u000atl;dr: give this place a try! You won't be sorry. :) The food is pretty amazing.
