VReturning to CV for one night only- Booked this place due to cost and location. The first room had the head boards pulled from the wall with nails sticking out- The room smelled like smoke depsite a warning that a $250 fine would be attached for smoking  LOL   The mattress literally slid off the frame.  So... I went to get another room- The man was fine and then we went to the room- It was located directly across from the elevator wall- This hotel has Bay views but this room was like a cave so... went to get a third room-  this one was passable but this place is not recommended. With the location being so great with the views you would think owners would put money in to take advantage-  An absolutely terrible place to stay !\u000a

VMy experience was so bad that my boyfriend and I couldn't even get a room. The front desk clerk accused us of smelling like smoke and we don't even smoke. She was very rude and had a poor attitude. I asked her if it was because we were black and she answered YES and I couldn't believe she admitted to it. Then she realized that I got offended and then she quickly changed her answer to no. She refused to give me her name after I asked for her it. Then she threatened to call the police. I informed her that I was going to let her manager know and she was yelling at me and told me to leave. I have never went through anything like that in my life. I called the manager today and informed him about the situation and he took my name and number and said he would contact me today after he spoke with her. I have yet to get a call from him today but I will be calling tomorrow. If nothing gets done I will be contacting 7 On Your Side and get this out to the public. People should never get treated like and this is never okay. I will keep you posted on what happened. NEVER COME HERE!!!
