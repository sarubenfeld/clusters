VThis month I stayed at this place for the third time. It is clean, comfortable, and very friendly. The large fireplace and the  leather couches in the common room are inviting. I love having my morning coffee on the deck with a great view of the bay.

VVisiting Point Reyes for the first time from NC. The motel was awesome: clean, friendly, inexpensive, and privacy. A great place to relax.

VI wanted to love it but I don't love bugs. Bugs in the shower, moths by the sink. We slept with the bathroom light on to keep them away from us while we slept and our room was tiny so the light kept me up. Other than the bugs and the tiny closet room 7 we had I loved it!

VI have stayed here many times and one of the great things is the view around Tomales Bay from the property, especialy from the duck blind, a short walk towards the bay.  There are only two houses that can be seen across a huge stretch of open space, the home next door, and, a home way up on a hill across the bay.  The result is a great sense of privacy and tranquility.\u000a\u000aUse of the great room at night and the large fireplace is a nice benefit and my friends and I spent many a late night shooting pool, listening to music and having a wine fest.\u000a\u000aOne suggestion is to bring some kindling and an axe, as the wood here is often too large to keep going w/o kindling, and I never spotted an axe anywhere.  \u000a\u000aThere are a ton of great hike to take nearby and a terrific selection of restaurants in Pt. Reyes Station.  The Olema Inn just south of P.R. Station is one of the best around for quality and it is less expensive on Monday nights.

VMy wife and I went there for our babymoon. It is a great place. The staff is friendly and the view of the bay from our room was beautiful. We could see a large number of egrets, ducks, geese, hummingbirds, and other fowl from the deck. We even saw a wild turkey roaming around. We were very pleased with our choice.\u000aKeep in mind that the address is 12718 Sir Francis Drake blvd. Google has some problem with numbering on this street. It has assigned a different location for this motel (off the bay and further along SFD blvd.) The correct place is the one with the view of the end of the bay in the back yard. There is an extended wooden walkway with a bird watching platform at the end of it in the backyard.
